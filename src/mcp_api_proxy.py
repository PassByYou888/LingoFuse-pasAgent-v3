mcp_api_proxy.py - Transparent stdio forwarder for MCP debugging (v2.6)

Usage:
    python mcp_api_proxy.py <real_command> [args...]
Example:
    python mcp_api_proxy.py python mcp_api_tool.py --transport stdio

The proxy launches the real command as a child process and forwards stdin,
stdout and stderr between the MCP client and the child. Every block of data
is logged to `proxy.log` (placed next to this script) and to stderr.

{!!!!!  NO JSON HANDLING  !!!!!}
This proxy operates purely at the byte level. It does NOT call
json.dumps or json.loads anywhere, does NOT touch a LingoFuse
DataHandle, and does NOT need the lf_io module.

The bytes that flow through it are opaque:

    * From the MCP client to the child, they are raw JSON-RPC frames
      framed by MCP's own transport protocol (one JSON object per
      line, terminated by a newline). The proxy forwards them
      unchanged.
    * From the child to the MCP client, they are the same kind of
      frames plus C-level diagnostic output emitted by the LingoFuse
      native library. The proxy applies a per-line JSON-RPC filter
      (only lines starting with '{' are forwarded) so that the MCP
      client never sees the diagnostic output, but it does not parse
      or re-serialize any of it.

Because no parsing or serialization happens here, this file is
explicitly OUTSIDE the scope of the lf_io unification. It has no
JSON policy to unify.

The only responsibility of this file is:
    1. Spawn the child process with correct pipe semantics.
    2. Forward bytes in both directions without modification (except
       for the JSON-RPC line filter on the Server->LM channel).
    3. Log every block to stderr and to proxy.log for debugging.

CHANGELOG (v2.6)
    * Documentation only: added an explicit note that this file does
      not perform any JSON handling, and clarified why it is outside
      the lf_io unification scope. No behavioural change.

CHANGELOG (v2.5)
    * Removed the top-level `signal.signal(SIGINT, ...)` handler.
      Reason: the handler called `sys.exit(0)`, which raises SystemExit.
      SystemExit bypasses the `except KeyboardInterrupt` block in
      `main()`, so pressing Ctrl+C never triggered the graceful child
      shutdown path (terminate -> wait -> kill). Instead, the child
      process relied on the OS closing the pipe, which worked but was
      not deterministic. Letting KeyboardInterrupt propagate naturally
      into `main()` restores the intended cleanup logic.

CHANGELOG (v2.4)
    * `_script_dir()` now uses `_is_frozen()`, which checks both
      `sys.frozen` and `sys._MEIPASS` (PyInstaller one-file mode).
      This matches the frozen detection used by mcp_api_tool.py.
    * Added `_setup_console()` to force UTF-8 encoding for stdout and
      stderr on Windows. Without this, log lines containing non-ASCII
      characters (e.g. Windows paths with Chinese characters) could be
      garbled when the console code page is GBK.

CHANGELOG (v2.3)
    * CRITICAL FIX: removed `bufsize=0` from subprocess.Popen.
      Reason: `bufsize=0` makes the child's stdin/stdout/stderr
      unbuffered `io.FileIO` objects, which on Windows are effectively
      non-blocking. FastMCP 4.x wraps stdin with anyio for async reads;
      a non-blocking stdin causes it to see immediate EOF, and the
      server exits about 20 ms after starting. Using the default
      bufsize (-1, buffered) restores normal blocking pipe semantics.
    * Tightened JSON-RPC line filter: only lines starting with '{' are
      considered JSON-RPC messages. MCP does not use JSON-RPC batch
      arrays, so lines starting with '[' (e.g. `[INFO] ...` diagnostic
      output) are also dropped from the client stream.

CHANGELOG (v2.2)
    * Uses `read1()` instead of `read()` so the reader thread returns
      as soon as any data is available.

CHANGELOG (v2.1)
    * Server->LM channel is line-filtered: only JSON-RPC lines are
      forwarded; other lines are dropped but still logged.
